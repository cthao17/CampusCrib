Design: User Interface and Technology Stack
Our design incorporates the classic UW Madison theme, utilizing white as the primary color and red for accents. This familiar color scheme fosters a welcoming atmosphere for students. Additionally, intuitive and user-friendly navigation ensures a seamless and enjoyable experience within the app. 
The app features several unique design elements, including real-time updates for messages and seamless integration of maps, camera, and notification functionalities.
Our development process involved learning and implementing several key features. One such feature was the integration of the Firebase Database, which enables efficient storage of user data and images. Furthermore, we successfully developed a chat activity to facilitate real-time communication between users. Finally, overcoming the challenge of image uploading and capture was a significant achievement.

Key Features: Our app boasts unique features that enhance mobile usability, including an integrated Google Maps location viewer and in-app chat functionality. The location viewer allows users to accurately pinpoint the location of listed items, while the chat feature facilitates direct communication between users within the app. This seamless integration eliminates the need for external applications, enabling users to find, list, and connect with others through a single, convenient platform.
